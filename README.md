# WolkenBot
Just a small discord bot for myself and my friends<br>
This is just the newest fully functional version of the bot.

# ToDo before using
You will need to replace the file names for the audio files you can play with file names of files on your system.<br>
You will need to put in your discord bot client secret<br>
You will need to have installed some sort of ffmpeg or replace the path in the file to ffmpeg.exe<br>
You will need to replace the API key for the google tenor api with your owns.

# Hardware requirements
This bot is easily running on a raspberry pi 4b 8gb (on raspberian), I wouldn't recomend this hardware for use on many servers but for a youple of servers it should be enough. But make sure you have everything installed what you need.
